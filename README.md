# Bookzone
Ironhack's bootcamp - Module 2 - Creating a CRUD App

## Description
A simple but efficient web application where the user can store already read and unread books

## Built with
- HTML, CSS, JS
- ExpressJS
- Adaptable
- MongoDB

## MVP
With just 5 days to develop this project we decided to keep it simple and straightforward, so our MVP looked like this:

- Home, signup, login, profile pages,
- Hash passwords using bcrypt on signup and login functions,
- Add new books to the db using Schema,
- Store the books in a database and show them on profile page,
- Update/Edit items on the database.
- Deploy the website using Adaptable

### Added bonus features
- Want to read / already read categories

### Not implemented yet backlog ideas
- Recomend me a book
- Follow another account
